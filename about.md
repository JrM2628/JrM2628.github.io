Hi, I'm Jake! I am interested in all things security but most of all I enjoy threat intelligence, offensive security and tool development, and DFIR. I also have professional experience in threat intelligence, software development, and incident response. Outside of security, I am interested in cars, auto racing, hockey, and gaming. This site serves as a platform to document projects and goals I've been working towards and to share my knowledge and experiences. Some of you may be wondering what the domain ```blog.apt41.cloud``` actually means. [APT41](https://www.mandiant.com/resources/blog/apt41-dual-espionage-and-cyber-crime-operation) is an Advanced Persistent Threat group [attributed](https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/cyber/apt-41-group) to China. I purchased the domain for use in a cyber attack/defend competition hosted by [RITSEC](https://www.ritsec.club/) and have had it ever since, so I decided to give it a second life hosting this blog.
