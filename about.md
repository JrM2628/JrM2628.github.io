title: About
---
Hi, I'm Jake! I am interested in all things security but most of all I enjoy threat intelligence, offensive security and tool development, and DFIR. I also have professional experience in threat intelligence, software development, and incident response. Outside of security, I am interested in cars, auto racing, hockey, and gaming. This site serves as a platform to document projects and goals I've been working towards and to share my knowledge and experiences.
